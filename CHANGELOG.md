# Changelog

Every release says three things before anything else: whether it needs a different MetaMorpheus, whether your machine
file needs a change, and whether it is safe to update while a batch is part-way through a queue. How to update:
section 7, "Updating", of [Getting started](https://smith-chem-wisc.github.io/PXReprise/getting-started.html).

A new version of the engine never changes a finished result. Methods live in versioned profiles
(`label-free-dda@2`), and every result's `provenance.json` records the PXReprise version that made it.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-29)

**Updating:** MetaMorpheus unchanged (1.1.11). Machine file: recommended new line `datarepo` (the dataRepo download);
new optional `search_timeout_h`, `search_stall_minutes`. Safe mid-batch: stop the batch, update, run it again.

- **The whole pipeline, with no Python.** Each searched deposit now goes into a [dataRepo](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/dataRepo)
  repository and a website, using dataRepo's ready-to-run download (0.31.0; Windows, Linux, macOS). `examples/first-run`
  ends with `work/site/index.html`. Getting started, step 3b, installs it.
- **A new question's manifest is created for it,** with roots relative to the manifest; an entry's `run` is taken
  against the manifest's own `work_root`. A `[publish]` command may use `{datarepo}` and `{manifest_dir}`.
- **A busy machine no longer kills searches.** A search's time limit was the profile's `timeout_h` (6 h), so
  MetaMorpheus 1.1.11's long, silent PEP step could be killed on a loaded box while still working. The limits now live
  in the machine file: `search_timeout_h` (default 48 h) is a ceiling, and `search_stall_minutes` (default 90) kills a
  search only when MetaMorpheus has used no CPU for that long, i.e. when it is hung. Profiles' `timeout_h` is read but
  no longer used. Provenance records the limits used, and says which one killed a search.
- **Provenance points at the public repository.** Each stage's `provenance.json` now names
  `https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/PXReprise` as `pipeline.repo`, instead of a development repository no reader
  could open.
- **The census record is renamed** from `pxreprise-provenance/1` to `pxreprise-run/1`. `pxreprise-provenance/1` is
  reserved for the per-stage record dataRepo ingests.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-29)

**Updating:** MetaMorpheus unchanged (1.1.11). Machine file unchanged; two optional settings are new. Safe mid-batch:
stop the batch, update, run it again.

- **A PRIDE outage no longer loses deposits.** A deposit whose downloads fail through every retry was settled for good
  as `fetch_failed`. It is now `fetch_unavailable`, not settled. The batch finishes the queue, waits, and tries it
  again, up to three passes in all, before settling it. A checksum mismatch or a missing file still settles at once.
- **New optional machine settings:** `fetch_passes` (default 3) and `pass_wait_minutes` (default 30).
- **A server timeout counts as an outage.** An HTTP timeout from PRIDE used to escape the retry handling; it is now
  retried like any other outage.
- **Docs:** how to update an installation (Getting started, section 7; `AGENTS.md`, "Updating").

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-29)

First public release. The batch, census and question tooling; profiles `label-free-dda@1` and `@2` (MetaMorpheus
1.1.11); the `first-run`, `t2d` and `muscle-ageing` examples; the documentation site and tutorial.
